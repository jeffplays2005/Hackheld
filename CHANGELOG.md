# 2.0.4
- Fixed wiring issues in 2.0.3 with the 5 directional button(UP was not working due to wrong wiring).
- Added github link
- Updated images to reflect changes to wiring.
- Improved wiring so less chances of manufacturing errors.
  - Shifted NEOPIXEL wiring so that the wiring is no longer underneath(prevents accidental solder going over the vias).
- Use releases instead of adding all the versions in the main folder

# 2.0.3 DEPRECATED
- Increased soldering hole size for A and B buttons for easier soldering and a flatter button(this removes the need to bend the pins out flat).
- Changed neopixel pads and instead of multi-layer connections, it is now a toplayer pad without holes for easier soldering. The pad length has also been increased.
- 6 directional switch is also no longer multi-layer pads. The pads have also been adjusted for easier soldering.
- Removed round board(i'm too beginner to create them anymore...)

# 2.0.2
- Changed wiring
- Removed soldering pad holes on multi level pads to make soldering easier
- Increased solder pad width for neopxl for easier soldering
- Added rounded corners option
- Updated files & images(replaced no component images with pdfs)

# 2.0.1
